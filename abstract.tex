Automated identification of individuals in endangered species have gained traction in nature conservation initiatives. Computer vision community have explored the use of the deep convolutions networks in identification and classification of wildlife: Chimpanzees and Gorillas producing high accuracy for classification tasks. However, these successes have not been tested in classification of other endangered wildlife like the big cats: Lions and Cheetahs. We provide an implementation of deep neural networks for individual classification of Lions and Cheetahs, and also compare the performance of different deep neural network architectures on individual identification using face image features. We envisage to replicate the success obtained in classification and identification tasks reported in Chimpanzee and human beings using face images. This will have an impact in assisting conservation initiatives to monitor report and manage biodiversity with minimal manual labour., and increased reliability of records about individuals in a Lion and Cheetah population.
