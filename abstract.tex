Automated identification of individuals in endangered species has gained traction in nature conservation initiatives. Computer vision community has explored the use of the deep convolutions networks in the identification and classification of wildlife: Chimpanzees and Gorillas producing high accuracy for classification tasks. However, these successes have not been tested in the classification of other endangered wildlife like the big cats: Lions and Cheetahs. We provide an implementation of deep neural networks for individual classification of Lions and Cheetahs and also present a comparison of the performance from different deep neural network architectures on individual identification using face image features. We envisage replicating the success obtained in classification and identification tasks reported in Chimpanzee and human beings using face images. This will have an impact in assisting conservation initiatives to monitor, report and manage biodiversity with minimal manual labor.
