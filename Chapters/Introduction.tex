\subsection{Automated Identification based on image traps}

Identification of objects is selecting an object among other objects based on unique features represented by one object \cite{jain2007handbook}. According to \citeauthor{jain2004introduction} \citeyear{jain2004introduction} \cite{jain2004introduction} there are conditions attached before a feature can be suitable for use in uniquely classifying a object. Firstly, the feature need to be universal; in other words all objects in same class must have such a feature. Secondly, any two objects must present a unique shape or form of the same feature, and lastly the feature should not change over a long period of time.

 \citeauthor{duda2012pattern} \citeyear{duda2012pattern} \cite{duda2012pattern} supports the argument made about the features that are used for classification an object and further stated that a sensing device is required to capture the signal that represent such features. Cameras are used to capture images of fingerprints so as apply computer models that extract features that can be used in classification of an individual person from a a database containing other people's fingerprint images. \citeauthor{maltoni2009handbook} \citeyear{maltoni2009handbook} \cite{maltoni2009handbook} explains why fingerprints are suitable features that can be used in uniquely identify an individual: Every person in the world has fingerprints, the fingerprints are unique between at least two individuals and fingerprint do not change over along period of time. However, injuries can change fingerprint patterns. That is one reason why \citeauthor{jain2004introduction} \citeyear{jain2004introduction} \cite{jain2004introduction} asserted that there is no single feature claimed to be the only most suitable feature for identification of objects. As a result, researchers have explored other features for use in classification of individuals: iris, face, palm and gait \cite{jain2007handbook}.     
 Automated identification has been applied in other fields like: medical to detect malignant cells \cite{khan2019novel,esteva2017dermatologist}, and in computer security to detect spam emails \cite{faris2019intelligent} using text features.
 
The fields in which automated identification is applied varies greatly, however all the previous works look at unique features that are used to discriminate dissimilar objects of same class.    

\subsection{Research Problem} 

Identification of individuals using biological and behavioral features falls in bio-metrics field \cite{jain2004introduction}. Automated individual identification has been studied extensively in human beings using face images as signals that provides discriminating features among faces of different people \cite{turk1991face}. \citeauthor{turk1991face}  \citeyear{turk1991face} \cite{turk1991face} extracted feature vectors that are relevant in distinguishing faces of different people. These feature were called eigenfaces. For identification purposes, a new face is projected to the eigenfaces space, a comparison is made to see which of the eigenfaces in database is close enough to the new face features by computing an Euclidean distance between known and new face eigenfaces. This work made assumptions that faces are usually upright, therefore the feature space was created based on upright faces. However, this assumption will only hold on face images taken from a controlled environment \cite{huang2008labeled}. This luxury can be attained with human beings, but its application is limited. Considering applying a similar approach to identifying wild animals can create problems because there is a limited chance to take a controlled face image of free roaming Lion.      

 \citeauthor{schroff2015facenet} \citeyear{schroff2015facenet} \cite{schroff2015facenet} developed a way of identification taking into account that face images of same person can vary in posture, lighting and expression. This removed the assumption that faces are usually upfront. This way of extracting features could be applicable to learning  features of animal face images because the posture of animal face may vary greatly. \citeauthor{schroff2015facenet} \citeyear{schroff2015facenet} \cite{schroff2015facenet} trained a deep convolutional neural network to recognize faces from images. An embedding is extracted from an image. Using a tripletloss approach, which takes three images; an anchor image $x_{i}^a$, a positive image $x_{i}^p$ and a negative image $x_{i}^n$. The network learns to minimize an euclidean distance between embeddings of anchor and positive images as shown in equation \ref{tripletpos:eq}, and increases the distance between anchor and negative image \ref{tripletneg:eq}. The positive image is any face image of the same subject, it may be a different face orientation or lighting condition. The negative image is face image of a different subject. A hyper-parameter $\alpha$ was used to force a certain distance from anchor and all negative images. 
 \begin{equation}\label{tripletpos:eq}
     \parallel f(x_{i}^a)-f(x_{i}^p)\parallel^2_2
 \end{equation}
 
 \begin{equation}\label{tripletneg:eq}
     \parallel f(x_{i}^a)-f(x_{i}^n)\parallel^2_2
 \end{equation}
 
 During training phase, the objective is to minimize the loss $L_triplet$, depicted by equation \ref{triplet:eq} adopted from \cite{schroff2015facenet}.     
 \begin{equation}\label{triplet:eq}
     L_{triplet} = \sum_{i}^N[\parallel f(x_{i}^a)-f(x_{i}^p)\parallel_{2}^2-\parallel f(x_{i}^a)-f(x_{i}^n)\parallel^2_2+\alpha] 
 \end{equation}
 
 One advantage \citeauthor{schroff2015facenet} \citeyear{schroff2015facenet} \cite{schroff2015facenet} have is the amount of training data at their disposal: over  $100$ million images from $8$ million different individuals. They reported varying accuracies on different datasets ranging between 95.18\% and 99.63\%. Such results encourages one to apply these techniques in endangered animal identification, however there number of animal images from South Africa game reserves is too low. It will be interesting to see the performance of this approach in animal data. 
Automated identification of animals has been focused on species identification \cite{norouzzadeh2018automatically}.
\citeauthor{parham2018animal} \citeyear{parham2018animal} \cite{parham2018animal} developed a pipeline for classification of species based on segmented sections of an image. The image segments called bounding boxes, were compared to labelled bound boxes of six species. They capitalized on different coat patterns presented by various species: coat pattern of zebras are distinct from coat patterns of giraffes. A bounding box is annotated with a specie label if it present a higher degree of similarity with known coat patterns the specie, compared to other species. \citeauthor{kuhl2013animal} \citeyear{kuhl2013animal} \cite{kuhl2013animal} asserted that other than just discriminating species, coat patterns can also be used as feature in discriminating individuals of the same specie.

Recent work has been done on identifying individual farm animals \cite{kumar2017real}. \citeauthor{kumar2017real} \citeyear{kumar2017real} \cite{kumar2017real} reflected on the importance knowing where each farm cow is located, and how many unique individuals are there in a farm. The benefits of identifying an individual lies in efficient record keeping about the individual, ability to track and count all known individuals, and easily recognize the missing. Computer assisted identification of animals have reduced the manual labour from custodians of farms, and also improved reliability of records about each individual \cite{kuhl2013animal}. \citeauthor{kuhl2013animal} \citeyear{kuhl2013animal} \cite{kuhl2013animal} observed that automated identification of individual animal have far reaching benefits in conservation research. The changes of an individual due to aging or habitat can be observed to determine if descendants of the individual exhibits similar adaptations to such changes. Interventions like individualized care could be made,  should there be a need, to ensure decedents of an individual are assisted to adapt better to external changes. Automated identification also present an non invasive way of tracking individuals compared to previous methods used in identification. \citeauthor{kuhl2013animal} \citeyear{kuhl2013animal} \cite{kuhl2013animal} further argues that collaring and implants are invasive ways of identification and may cause changes in behaviour, reproduction and ability to survive for individual animal. These have negative effects on conservation initiatives, may further decrease endangered species.

These benefits are relevant in endangered wild animals. As noted by \citeauthor{norouzzadeh2018automatically} \citeyear{norouzzadeh2018automatically} \cite{norouzzadeh2018automatically}, that conservationists will leverage on automated counting and tracking animals so as to report on biodiversity reliably, with less human effort and disturbances on the habitat of wild animals. There is work ongoing to keep records of species for tourist attraction and nature conservation purposes in South African reserves \cite{marnewick2008evaluating}. 

\subsection{Finally}
Computer vision has evolved from using hand engineered features for classification of images to features learned automatically by algorithms. \citeauthor{wang2009hog} \citeyear{wang2009hog} \cite{wang2009hog} demonstrated that histogram oriented gradients (HOG) image features are good in estimating the shape of an object and local binary pattern (LBP) are good features for texture analysis. \citeauthor{}{wang2009hog} \citeyear{wang2009hog} \cite{wang2009hog} proposed a combination of these features in detecting human faces, leveraging on the strength of each feature: local binary patterns are robust in noisy pictures and can be used to filter irrelevant pixels from image, this will enhance HOG in detecting the shape and edges of the object in the picture since HOG suffers greatly when the image has noise. 

Researches have moved towards more adaptive methods of learning features from images. These methods involves mimicking how the human brain analyses and remembers patterns. The methods called deep neural networks have demonstrated high accuracy in image classification tasks than histogram of gradients and local binary patterns features \cite{suleiman2017towards}. However,  \citeauthor{suleiman2017towards}  \citeyear{suleiman2017towards} \cite{suleiman2017towards}reflected on the fact that even though neural networks perform better, there is a trade-off; neural networks demand more computational resources compared to histogram of gradients. Powerful computer resources are now freely available \footnote{https://colab.research.google.com/}, this supports experimentation that exploit the power of neural networks in classification tasks.     

\citeauthor{weinstein2018computer} \citeyear{weinstein2018computer} \cite{weinstein2018computer} show how different configurations of neural networks have brought more improvements on classification of wild animals. The state-of-the-art in computer vision being convolutional neural networks \cite{verma2018wild}.

\section{Problem Statement}
 %-----      IDEAL  -------%
Automated individual identification of endangered wildlife has been investigated using chimpanzees and Gorilla face images, and Fruit flies. Approaches employed here are state-of-the-art deep neural networks and there are plausible successes on individual of these species. Proper record keeping about endangered wild life is the focus of conservation initiatives. Automated computer identification enhances these efforts by reducing human errors.      
%  --------  REALITY   ---------%
However, endangered wild animals include more than just Chimpanzees. Big cats like Lions, Tigers and Cheetahs are species threatened by extinction. Literature does not show that automated identification of individual cats has been investigated. It therefore clear that the processing of record keep of other individual species is still done manually, if at all, and is prone to human error.        
%    ----- IMPROVEMENTS------   %
In response to this problem we  propose to investigate and implement automated identification of big cats: lions and Cheetahs using deep neural networks; with the focus of finding out if the successes made in identification of Chimpanzees and Gorillas can be extended to other species. 

\section{Significance and Motivation}
Endangered  animals in South Africa are on the decline, and effort to curb this are being investigated \cite{marnewick2008evaluating}. Approaches to assist in this should be  multi-disciplinary. While \citeauthor{marnewick2018cheetaprob} \citeyear{marnewick2018cheetaprob} \cite{marnewick2018cheetaprob} is leading data collection, counting and reporting on wildlife in major parks found in South Africa, their strategies involve collaring individuals for identification purposes. 
This work would like to investigate none-invasive means of identification, to avoid the adverse effects collaring and other invasive identification methods. 

The successes made in computer vision discipline for automated image analysis for identification has brought opportunities that can be applied in individual animal identification though camera traps. It is envisioned that such approach will improved accuracy of reporting on wildlife demographics, and remove human error in individual animal identification.

\section{Research Questions}
The main question of this research work is: 
How can deep neural networks be used to automate individual animal identification the using camera trap images?

The main question has been broken down into the following sub questions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item How can deep neural networks be used to reliably assist in record keeping about individual animal roaming in the wild?
    \item Which neural network produce features best suited for individual identification of Lions and Cheetah face images between convolutional neural network and Siamese convolutional neural networks.      
\end{itemize}

\section{Delineations, Limitations and Assumptions}

This research will only focus on endangered Lion and Cheetah populations found in Kruger National Park in South Africa. The Kruger National park is viable option because of its proximity. Time constrains have limited the work to focus on only the two species, Lion and Cheetah. More resources would be required so as to consider other endangered species.

We cannot ascertain that the outcomes presented will generalize to other endangered species found in Kruger national park and other regions.

This work relies on Human beings for labeling of individual animal images, and this labeling is assumed to be correct.
