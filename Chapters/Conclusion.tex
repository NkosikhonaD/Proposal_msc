\chapter{Conclusion}
Literature study have shown that deep neural networks have produced state-of-the-art performance in classification problems. Siamese convolutional neural networks in  particular are reported to be best suited for image classification. These have been applied successfully in identification of individual human beings using face images and also in identification of Chimpanzees. Applying computer assisted individual identification has benefits in monitoring, managing and reporting on wildlife,especially endangered species.

However, there has not been work that probed how Siamese neural networks can perform in classification of individuals from other species like Lions and Cheetahs. It is therefore necessary to carry out investigation and report on how deep neural network can assist in classification of the big cats in-order to support reliable record keeping about these endangered species.
